Design automations that are reliable, documented, and secure. I help teams map processes, build robust Zapier workflows, and establish monitoring so automations stay healthy as systems change.

## Platform overview

Zapier connects tools across the business to remove manual effort. Success depends on disciplined design, error handling, and documentation as processes evolve.

## My role

- Translate operational processes into resilient automation pathways.
- Establish guardrails for authentication, data handling, and change control.
- Build monitoring and alerting so teams know when to intervene.

## Typical engagements

- Fix broken zap triggers or actions. We can help if you have actions that do not always fire or triggers that don't complete in the way you expect.
- Create complex multiple step zaps. Translate your physical and offline processes into Zapier by using the power of multiple step Zaps
- Integrate with platforms not on Zapier. f you have a bespoke platform or one that is not currently listed in Zapier's app directory, we can create a custom integration for you

## Value to clients

- Less manual work and fewer errors across repetitive processes.
- Clear ownership and documentation for every automation.
- Confidence that automations scale with new tools and volume.
- Integration with company data for AI processing
