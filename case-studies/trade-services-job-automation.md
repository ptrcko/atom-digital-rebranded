## Overview

Helped a large Queensland-based electrical and HVAC contractor streamline how quotes, jobs, and invoices move through their operational systems. The work reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, and established a clearer workflow for office and field teams.

## Business problem

- Job and quote data was coming from multiple systems and wasn’t flowing cleanly, causing duplicate jobs, missing details, and manual rework.  
- Integration behaviour was inconsistent, with authentication errors, failed connections, and unreliable data updates.  
- Staff needed clearer processes for how new work should be captured, prioritised, and pushed into their job management system.  
- Leadership wanted visibility and a plan for improving automation without overwhelming the team.

## Approach

- Spoke with the management team to understand how the business handles new jobs, urgent callouts, quotes, and invoicing.  
- Reviewed recent data flows, system logs, and job records to identify why jobs were being duplicated or created incorrectly.  
- Worked closely with office staff to clarify expectations, clean up data, and make sure system rules matched how the business actually operates.  
- Coordinated with support teams from their software providers to resolve authentication issues and fix problems in the background systems.  
- Introduced simpler rules around job creation, filtering, and data matching so the team could trust the outcomes.  
- Tested the improved process live with staff, adjusting steps as needed and confirming behaviour across real transactions.  
- Provided clear next steps and documentation so the team could own the process and continue improving it over time.

## Outcome

- A more reliable flow of quotes, jobs, and invoices between systems with fewer errors and reduced manual follow-up.  
- Clearer expectations for staff on how new work should be captured, prioritised, and moved through the workflow.  
- Reduced duplication and cleaner job records, improving accuracy for scheduling, dispatch, and reporting.  
- Stronger partnership with software vendors to support ongoing improvements.
- A documented plan for further automation and efficiency gains heading into 2026.
