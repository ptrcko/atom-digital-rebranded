## Overview

Implemented ticketing platforms with clear workflows, SLAs, and reporting.

## Business problem

- Service teams lacked visibility of demand, response times, and ownership.
- Work categorisation and automation were inconsistent, slowing resolution.
- Leadership needed reporting to manage risk and resource planning.

## Approach

- Designed workflows, categories, and automation aligned to support policies.
- Set SLAs, escalation paths, and dashboards for operational and executive visibility.
- Used existing data to create AI automation and canned responses.
- Implemented external help centre for customer self service.
- Trained teams on usage, quality measures, and continuous improvement.

## Outcome

- Improved response times and transparency for customers and stakeholders.
- Reliable reporting on demand, backlog, and service quality.
- Reduced ticket numbers through self service portals and education material.
- Stronger accountability through clear ownership and governance.
