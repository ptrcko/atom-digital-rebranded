## Overview

Implemented ticketing platforms with clear workflows, SLAs, and reporting.

## Business problem

- Service teams lacked visibility of demand, response times, and ownership.
- Work categorisation and automation were inconsistent, slowing resolution.

- Set SLAs, escalation paths, and dashboards for operational and executive visibility.
- Trained teams on usage, quality measures, and continuous improvement.

## Outcome

- Improved response times and transparency for customers and stakeholders.
- Reliable reporting on demand, backlog, and service quality.
- Stronger accountability through clear ownership and governance.
