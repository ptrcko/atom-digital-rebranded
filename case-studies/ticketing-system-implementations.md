## Overview

Implemented ticketing platforms with clear workflows, SLAs, and reporting so service teams could respond faster and with great
er accountability. Work covered customer-facing support and internal IT service desks.

## Business problem

- Service teams lacked visibility of demand, response times, and ownership, leading to delayed responses and frustrated custome
rs.
- Work categorisation and automation were inconsistent, creating rework and slowing resolution.
- Leadership needed trustworthy reporting on backlog, SLAs, and quality to manage risk and plan resources.

## Approach

- Designed workflows, categories, and automation aligned to support policies and service expectations.
- Set SLAs, escalation paths, and dashboards for operational and executive visibility, with alerts for exceptions.
- Used existing data to build macros, AI-assisted responses, and routing rules that reduced manual handling.
- Implemented external help centres and knowledge bases to encourage customer self-service.
- Trained teams on quality measures, triage, and continuous improvement so new processes stuck.

## Outcome

- Improved response times and transparency for customers and stakeholders.
- Reliable reporting on demand, backlog, and service quality, supporting resourcing decisions.
- Reduced ticket numbers through self-service portals, guided forms, and education material.
- Stronger accountability through clear ownership, governance, and visible SLAs.
