## Overview

Implemented scheduling automations and alerts within Deputy to reduce manual effort, improve compliance confidence, and keep la
bour visibility accurate across sites.

## Business problem

- Manual rostering and ad-hoc approvals created errors, compliance risk, and frustrated managers.
- Data inconsistencies between Deputy, payroll, and reporting systems caused rework and delayed pay runs.
- Leaders needed clear visibility of labour costs, coverage, and exceptions to manage profitability.

## Approach

- Designed rostering rules, alerts, and approvals aligned to award requirements and business policies.
- Integrated Deputy with payroll and reporting systems for accurate data flow and quicker reconciliation.
- Cleaned and standardised data so scheduling, leave, and overtime behaved predictably.
- Trained managers on exception handling, audits, and governance to keep processes consistent.

## Outcome

- Reduced manual effort and improved compliance confidence across rosters and approvals.
- Cleaner payroll inputs with fewer adjustments required and faster processing.
- Clear visibility of scheduling, labour costs, and coverage for leaders through consistent reporting.
