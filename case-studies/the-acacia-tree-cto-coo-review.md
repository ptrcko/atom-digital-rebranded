## Overview

Delivered a combined CTO/COO review covering technology stack, vendor performance, and operating model for a multi-centre early
 childhood organisation.

## Business problem

- Leadership needed clarity on technology risks, vendor performance, and operational gaps without disrupting families or staff.

- Prioritised risks and opportunities, aligning them to measurable business outcomes and compliance needs.
- Presented a staged roadmap with ownership, investment needs, and success metrics the leadership team could action quickly.

## Outcome

- Prioritised initiatives with agreed owners and timelines, giving teams confidence to act.
- Leadership confidence through concise reporting, governance recommendations, and vendor expectations.
