## Overview

Led delivery of an AI solution to optimise routing decisions.

## Business problem

- Complex routing decisions needed to account for operational and regulatory constraints.
- Teams required confidence in model outputs before adopting them in production.
- Stakeholders wanted measurable performance improvements without disrupting safety.

## Approach

- Developed models incorporating operational rules, constraints, and historical data.
- Established testing, simulation, and validation processes with domain experts.
- Built change management and training to integrate AI outputs into workflows.

## Outcome

- Optimised routing recommendations aligned with safety and regulatory expectations.
- Teams trusted the solution through transparent validation and documentation.
- Clear metrics demonstrated performance improvements and informed ongoing tuning.
