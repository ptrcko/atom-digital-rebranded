## Overview

Delivered a structured Zoho CRM rollout that aligned with sales and service processes, giving teams a single view of customers
 and clearer handoffs.

## Business problem

- Sales and service teams lacked a unified system and consistent data, making collaboration and reporting difficult.
- Manual processes slowed handoffs, follow-ups, and insight into pipeline health.
- Adoption risked stalling without clear training, governance, and well-designed automation.

## Approach

- Mapped customer journeys into CRM pipelines, fields, and automation so processes matched how teams work.
- Migrated and cleansed data, establishing standards for ongoing quality and integration readiness.
- Built automation for notifications, tasking, and approvals to reduce manual effort.
- Produced training, playbooks, and governance so adoption would stick beyond go-live.

## Outcome

- Unified customer data and workflows across teams with clear ownership.
- Faster handoffs and improved reporting on pipeline and service performance through purposeful automation.
- Confident adoption supported by training, governance, and accessible playbooks.
