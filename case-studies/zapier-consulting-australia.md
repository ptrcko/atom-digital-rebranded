## Overview

We assist organisations in streamlining their operations using Zapier—whether it's reducing repetitive administration, improving response times, or connecting systems that normally can't talk to each other. Our work spans industries including recruitment, field services, education, ecommerce, insurance, construction, and automotive, supporting teams with both day-to-day automations and business-critical processes.

## Business problem

- Many businesses start with basic Zaps but quickly exceed the limits of single-step automations.  
- As workflows grow, error rates increase, exceptions appear, and Zaps become difficult to maintain without clear structure or governance.  
- Teams often face inconsistent triggers, broken actions, “half-completed” workflows, or Zaps that run unpredictably.  
- Some organisations rely on platforms not listed in Zapier’s app directory, making automation feel out of reach.  
- Leaders want automation that reduces admin effort without increasing operational costs or Zapier task usage.

## Approach

- Worked closely with each business to understand how data moves through their systems and where automation will make the highest impact.  
- Designed multi-step Zaps—often 15–25 steps—using smart logic, error handling, branching, and notifications to create reliable, predictable workflows.  
- Built custom integrations for platforms not available in Zapier, allowing teams to automate processes previously handled entirely by hand.  
- Used Zapier’s native features as efficiently as possible to minimise task consumption and ongoing subscription costs.  
- Added custom code steps where needed to handle exceptions, transform data, or connect to APIs beyond Zapier’s built-in capabilities.  
- Created workflow diagrams to give teams clarity on how each automation behaves from start to finish.  
- Offered two delivery models:  
  - **Handover model:** full training so internal teams can manage and grow their own Zaps.  
  - **Managed service:** we maintain the Zapier account, troubleshoot issues, and handle ongoing improvements.

## Outcome

- Hundreds of high-quality, multi-step automations deployed across diverse industries.  
- Significant reductions in manual work through reliable workflows that run consistently—even when logic is complex or data is unpredictable.  
- Improved operational speed and accuracy thanks to automated exception handling, structured branching, and early-warning notifications.  
- Organisations using platforms without a Zapier integration can now automate core processes through customised connectors.  
- Reduced Zapier costs through optimised task usage and efficient workflow structure.  
- Stronger team capability, whether through complete handover and training or through a fully managed automation service.  
- A long-term automation foundation that evolves with the organisation as processes mature.
