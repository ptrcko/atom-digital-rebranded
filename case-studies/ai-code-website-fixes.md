## Overview

Applied AI-assisted diagnostics and fixes to stop outages, harden performance, and remove risky code paths. Work was delivered
alongside internal developers and vendors so improvements were adopted quickly and safely.

## Business problem

- Customer-facing sites were experiencing outages, slowdowns, and unpredictable behaviour during peak periods.
- Root causes were undocumented, making triage difficult and extending resolution time.
- Leadership needed transparent recovery without introducing new risk to security or customer experience.

## Approach

- Used AI-assisted tooling and targeted reviews to surface code defects, configuration drift, and infrastructure bottlenecks.
- Prioritised remediation by customer impact, security posture, and business risk, keeping stakeholders informed at each step.
- Paired with developers and vendors to apply fixes, add guardrails, and validate behaviour in production-like environments.
- Implemented monitoring, logging, and runbooks so future incidents could be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

## Outcome

- Restored site stability with improved response times and fewer regressions during high-traffic events.
- Clear runbooks, alerts, and dashboards in place so teams could manage incidents confidently.
- Stakeholders gained confidence through transparent metrics, change notes, and validated fixes.
