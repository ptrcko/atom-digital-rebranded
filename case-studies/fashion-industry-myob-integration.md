## Overview

Connected MYOB with ecommerce, B2B, and logistics platforms to streamline data flows, improve financial reporting, and support accurate, timely inventory visibility across the business.

## Business problem

- Fragmented data across MYOB, ecommerce platforms, logistics systems, and B2B sites created ongoing reconciliation issues.  
- Inventory adjustments were not consistently reflected in MYOB, and mismatched timestamps caused gaps in downstream reporting.  
- Seasonal trading peaks highlighted manual workarounds, system timeouts, and unreliable synchronisation.  
- Leadership required a clear, reliable picture of performance across brands, ranges, and channels.

## Approach


- Spent time with the team—both onsite and remotely—to understand how sales, inventory, and finance were meant to work together across the business.  
- Reviewed the data coming from MYOB, the ecommerce stores, the B2B platform, and logistics partners to identify where numbers were going missing or becoming unreliable.  
- Worked through each part of the process with the team to clean up product information, align naming and categories, and make sure updates flowed consistently.  
- Coordinated with MYOB and SyncHub support to resolve gaps, discrepancies, and unexpected behaviour in the data.  
- Simplified and improved the way inventory information moved between systems so the team could trust what they were seeing day to day.  
- Tested each step with the business during busy and quiet periods to make sure it held up in real-world use.  
- Provided clear guidance, checklists, and processes so the team could take ownership of the system without relying on outside help for routine tasks.

## Outcome

- Accurate and reliable financial and inventory reporting with substantially fewer manual adjustments.  
- Stable, automated inventory synchronisation across MYOB, ecommerce, B2B, and logistics systems.  
- Improved peak-period performance through predictable scheduling, monitoring, and escalation processes.  
- Stronger data ownership within the team, supported by clear documentation, reporting tools, and integration insights.  
- Leadership gained confidence through timely, consistent data for decision-making across all brands and channels.
