## Overview

Led a reporting consolidation program to unify data sources into Power BI.

## Business problem

- Reporting was fragmented across spreadsheets and systems, creating conflicting numbers.
- Data governance and definitions were inconsistent.
- Stakeholders needed reliable, self-service insights.

## Approach

- Built governed data models with shared definitions and refresh processes.
- Standardised dashboards for executives and operational teams.
- Delivered training and support so stakeholders trusted and used the new reports.

## Outcome

- Single source of truth for key metrics across the organisation.
- Reduced manual reporting effort and fewer conflicting numbers.
- Greater adoption of data-driven decisions through trusted Power BI assets.
