## Overview

Led a reporting consolidation program to unify data sources into Power BI, creating a single source of truth for executive and
operational teams.

## Business problem

- Reporting was fragmented across spreadsheets and systems, creating conflicting numbers and manual effort.
- Data governance and definitions were inconsistent, eroding trust in reported metrics.
- Stakeholders needed reliable, self-service insights without chasing multiple teams for data.

## Approach

- Built governed data models with shared definitions, lineage, and reliable refresh processes.
- Standardised dashboards for executives and operational teams, focusing on the metrics they use to run the business.
- Delivered training, change communications, and support so stakeholders trusted and used the new reports.

## Outcome

- Single source of truth for key metrics across the organisation.
- Reduced manual reporting effort and fewer conflicting numbers through governed models.
- Greater adoption of data-driven decisions through trusted Power BI assets and trained users.
