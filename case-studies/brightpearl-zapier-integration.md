## Overview

Designed and implemented Zapier flows to synchronise orders, inventory, and customer notifications.

## Business problem

- Manual processes created delays and data mismatches across orders and inventory.
- Existing automations lacked documentation and monitoring.
- Teams needed clarity on ownership and support processes.

## Approach

- Mapped key workflows and data contracts between Brightpearl and adjacent platforms.
- Designed Zapier automations with error handling, alerting, and documentation.
- Provided runbooks and training so internal teams could manage changes safely.

## Outcome

- Faster order and inventory updates with fewer manual touches.
- Clear operational ownership and support processes for automations.
- Improved confidence in data accuracy across connected systems.
