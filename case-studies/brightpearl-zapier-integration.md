## Overview

A Victorian-based supplier of security products needed a way to scale operations without compromising customer service. Their business was growing quickly, and the team wanted to shift repetitive tasks to automation so they could focus on high-touch customer needs. However, their core system—Brightpearl—had no Zapier integration.

We designed, built, and launched a fully custom Zapier integration that now supports accounting syncs, website functionality, customer self-service, and internal workflow automation.

## Business problem

- The company was growing and needed its systems to handle repetitive, low-value tasks.  
- The team wanted to maintain a high level of customer service while reducing manual administration.  
- Brightpearl, their core operational system, had no native Zapier integration, limiting automation opportunities.  
- They needed a scalable, reliable way to connect Brightpearl with Xero, their website, and internal processes.

## Approach

- Met with leadership and operational teams to understand bottlenecks, repetitive tasks, and customer touchpoints where speed mattered most.  
- Analysed Brightpearl’s API documentation to identify what could be automated and how workflows should behave.  
- Designed a custom Zapier integration that included key triggers (e.g., new entries, new contacts, order updates) and actions (e.g., updating orders, creating notes, processing payments, and initiating fulfilment).  
- Built two-way synchronisation between Brightpearl and Xero, enabling financial and operational data to stay aligned automatically.  
- Supported website integrations and customer self-service features by automating order creation, updates, and account-level actions.  
- Provided a fully managed service: rollout, team onboarding, ongoing updates, and a rapid request process for enhancements.

## Outcome

- A reliable, custom-built Zapier integration that has operated continuously since 2018.  
- Over 400,000 automated requests per year, reducing manual work and improving operational accuracy.  
- Eight major upgrades and more than 350 minor improvements delivered as business needs evolved.  
- A scalable automation foundation that supports the company’s growth, customer experience expectations, and system modernisation goals.  
- A long-term relationship where automation is fully managed, and the team can request new workflows or improvements whenever needed.
