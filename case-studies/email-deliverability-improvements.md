## Overview

Resolved deliverability issues through domain alignment, authentication, and content governance across marketing and operationa
l email programs.

## Business problem

- Marketing and operational emails were landing in spam or failing authentication checks across multiple platforms.
- Sender reputation was deteriorating, impacting critical communications and customer trust.
- Teams needed sustainable governance to avoid repeat issues as campaigns evolved.

## Approach

- Implemented SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and alignment across sending domains and platforms, closing configuration gaps.
- Audited content and sending practices, introducing segmentation, warm-up plans, and approval processes where needed.
- Set up monitoring, reporting, and runbooks to maintain reputation and flag risks early.

## Outcome

- Improved deliverability and restored sender reputation across marketing and operational streams.
- Clear processes for future campaigns and operational communications, reducing the chance of recurrence.
- Leadership visibility into deliverability metrics and risk indicators through shared dashboards and playbooks.
