## Overview

Provided fractional CTO/COO leadership to stabilise systems, improve data visibility, and guide vendor delivery while the organi
sation scaled services across the region.

## Business problem

- Fragmented systems and inconsistent reporting were slowing customer delivery and decision-making.
- Vendors were not aligned to commercial priorities or service expectations, creating rework and delays.
- Teams needed clearer roles, rituals, and escalation paths to coordinate work effectively.

## Approach

- Conducted a rapid assessment of architecture, data flows, and vendor contracts to pinpoint risks and gaps.
- Introduced delivery cadence with stand-ups, risk reviews, and executive updates to stabilise communication.
- Simplified reporting to give leadership visibility of commitments, blockers, and risk ownership.
- Coached internal leads to manage vendors and hold them accountable to outcomes and SLAs.

## Outcome

- More predictable delivery and improved customer communication through disciplined cadence.
- Data visibility that supported quicker decision-making across teams and services.
- Vendors operating to clearer governance and performance measures, reducing churn and escalations.
