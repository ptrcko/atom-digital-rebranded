## Overview

Delivered custom AI solutions covering data preparation, model selection, and deployment, ensuring teams understood how to use
 and govern each capability.

## Business problem

- Teams wanted AI-enabled processes but lacked clear governance and delivery structure to manage risk.
- Data readiness and stakeholder alignment were inconsistent across departments, slowing progress.
- Leadership needed assurance on safety, compliance, and ROI before scaling.

## Approach

- Scoped opportunities with clear hypotheses, success metrics, and decision gates.
- Prepared data pipelines, selected models, and implemented responsible-use controls covering privacy, bias, and security.
- Ran pilots with training and feedback loops before scaling, validating performance and usability.
- Set up monitoring and incident processes for production deployments.

## Outcome

- AI capabilities delivered with documented controls and monitoring that satisfied governance expectations.
- Stakeholders gained confidence through measurable pilot results and transparent decision records.
- Playbooks provided for future AI initiatives across the organisation, reducing time to value on new ideas.
