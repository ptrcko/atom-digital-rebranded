## Overview

Created and implemented cybersecurity policies tailored to organisational risk, balancing regulatory expectations with practic
al controls that teams could follow day to day.

## Business problem

- Policies were outdated, inconsistent, or lacked enforcement, leaving gaps in coverage and accountability.
- Teams needed clear guidance on roles, responsibilities, and incident handling, especially during high-pressure events.
- Vendor controls and onboarding requirements were not standardised, increasing third-party risk.

## Approach

- Developed a policy suite aligned to risk appetite and regulatory expectations, focusing on achievable controls.
- Introduced training, simulations, and communication plans tailored for staff and vendors so expectations were understood.
- Implemented incident response workflows and playbooks with clear escalation paths and ownership.
- Established vendor onboarding and review processes to enforce security requirements consistently.

## Outcome

- Up-to-date policies embedded in day-to-day operations with measurable adoption.
- Improved awareness and response readiness across teams and suppliers through regular training and rehearsals.
- Clear vendor requirements reducing third-party security risk and speeding onboarding decisions.
