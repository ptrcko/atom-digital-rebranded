Each engagement is tailored to the realities of the organisation. I support:

## Startups and scaleups

- Technical direction, investor readiness, and delivery discipline.
- Foundations for security, data, and automation as teams grow.
- Coaching for emerging leaders so momentum continues after the engagement.

## Established businesses

- Modernising legacy systems while protecting day-to-day operations.
- Governance and vendor oversight across complex stacks and compliance requirements.
- Change management for teams adopting new platforms and processes.

## Organisations in transition

- Interim leadership during mergers, restructures, or leadership changes.
- Rapid assessments of risk, capability, and delivery to stabilise performance.
- Operating rhythms and reporting that keep stakeholders aligned during change.

## Engagement approach

- Calibrate scope to your stage, budget, and regulatory context.
- Communicate clearly with executives, boards, and frontline teams.
- Leave behind documentation, playbooks, and measures that enable ongoing success.
