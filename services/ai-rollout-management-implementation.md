AI initiatives succeed when governance, data readiness, and training are addressed together. I oversee AI programs from discovery to adoption, ensuring teams understand how to use new capabilities safely.

## Who it’s for

- Leaders exploring AI opportunities but needing clear guardrails.
- Organisations piloting AI workflows who want to avoid fragmented experiments.
- Teams requiring structured change management and training to adopt AI responsibly.

## What’s included

- AI opportunity mapping tied to operational goals and measurable success criteria.
- Vendor assessment, data readiness checks, and risk controls including privacy and security.
- Pilot design with clear hypotheses, metrics, and feedback loops.
- Enablement plans covering communications, training, and ongoing governance.

## Benefits

- Confident AI adoption with clear risk management and compliance alignment.
- Faster path from pilot to production with defined standards and documentation.
