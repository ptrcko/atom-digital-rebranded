AI initiatives succeed when governance, data readiness, and training are addressed together. I oversee AI programs from discovery to adoption, ensuring teams understand how to use new capabilities safely.

Focus areas:
- AI opportunity mapping linked to operational goals
- Vendor selection, data safeguards, and change management
- Pilot design, measurement, and scale-up support
