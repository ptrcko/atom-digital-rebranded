Understand how fractional CTO or COO support can be structured for your organisation. Engagements can be scoped by outcomes, hours, or project phases, ensuring you invest at the right level.

## Who it’s for

- Organisations comparing leadership options without committing to a full-time executive.
- Teams that want clarity on how scope, cadence, and reporting affect investment.
- Boards seeking transparency on cost drivers and value measures.

## What’s included

- A guided discussion to match engagement models to your objectives and timelines.
- Draft cadence, governance, and reporting approach aligned to stakeholders.
- Recommendations on whether CTO, COO, or technology partner support — or a blend — suits your needs.

## What influences cost

- Complexity of your technology stack and operational footprint.
- Governance, risk, and reporting expectations from leadership and boards.
- Urgency of delivery, including any critical remediation or change management requirements.

## Benefits

- Clear understanding of investment options before work begins.
- Right-sized scope that balances ambition with pragmatic delivery.
- Confidence that cost aligns to measurable outcomes, not just effort.

## Why it matters

Early clarity on scope and cadence keeps delivery predictable and avoids overcommitting. A cost conversation upfront ensures the engagement stays focused on value.
