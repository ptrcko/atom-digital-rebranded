# AGENTS.md — Behaviour Guidelines for AI

Use these rules when generating or updating content in this repository.

## Purpose
- Build and maintain a production-ready Jekyll website for a Fractional CTO / COO and Technology Partner with 20+ years of C-level experience.
- Provide concise, professional content in Australian English.

## Do not
- Invent new services, partnerships, or case studies beyond the defined sitemap.
- Change strategic meaning or tone.
- Modify the sitemap structure unless explicitly instructed.

## Front matter
Every page requires:

```
---
title: "<Page Title>"
layout: "<layout>"
description: "<Short description>"
permalink: "/<slug>/"
---
```

## Formatting and slugs
- Use Markdown content with semantic HTML in layouts.
- Slugs are lowercase, hyphenated, and match the sitemap exactly.

## Behaviour
- Ask for clarification if unsure about intent or content.
- Keep copy concise, credible, and aligned to the services described.
