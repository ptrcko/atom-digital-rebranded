A fractional COO embeds operational leadership part-time to stabilise processes, guide teams, and improve performance. It is ideal for organisations experiencing rapid growth, change, or complexity but not yet ready for a full-time appointment.

Expected outcomes:
- Clear operating rhythms and KPIs across functions
- Streamlined processes that reduce waste and improve quality
- Stronger coordination between technology, finance, and customer delivery
